sutra: प्रहासे च मन्योपपदे मन्यतेरुत्तम एकवच्च

When one person wants to make fun of what other person thinks, and he uses the verb 'मन्' to indicate the thinking process, the verb मन् is used in उत्तमपुरुष-एकवचन and the other verb is used in  मध्यमपुरुष. For example, consider this statement - 'Do you think you can eat the rice' (एहि मन्ये ओदनम् भोक्ष्यसे)? Here the speaker is making fun of the thinking process of other person, saying that the other person is thinking he could eat the rice, but he would not be able to. In such a case, the verb मन् would get उत्तमपुरुष (instead of ideally getting मध्यमपुरुष), and the other word  (भुज् in this case) would get मध्यमपुरुष instead of ideally getting उत्तमपुरुष). So, instead of saying  रे बुभुक्षित, किम् त्वं एतत् मन्यसे यत् अहम् ओदनम् भोक्ष्ये, we would say - एहि मन्ये ओदनम् भोक्ष्यसे?
