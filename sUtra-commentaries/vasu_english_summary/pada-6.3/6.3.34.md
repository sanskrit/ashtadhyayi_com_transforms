In the room of a feminine word there is substituted an equivalent and uniform masculine form when it is a word which has an actual corresponding masculine and does not end in the feminine affix ऊङ् and is followed by another feminine word in the relation of apposition with it, but not when such subsequent word is an ordinal numeral, nor प्रिय etc.
