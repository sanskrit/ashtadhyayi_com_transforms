In Patronymics used in narrower sense (counting first from the grand-child), which are formed the affixes अण् and इञ् , the feminine is formed by substituting य (ष्यङ्) for the अ and इ of those affixes and adding the long आ under -- यङश्चाप् [[4.1.74]], provided that they do not denote ऋषि clans and have prosodially long syllable preceding the last syllable.
