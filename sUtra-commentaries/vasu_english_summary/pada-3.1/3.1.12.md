sutra: भृशादिभ्यो भुव्यच्वेर्लोपश्च हलः

The affix क्यङ् in the sense of becoming what the thing previously was not, is used after the crude forms भृश् etc. which do not end with the affix च्वि -- अभूततद्भावे कृभ्वस्तियोगे सम्पद्यकर्तरि च्विः [[5.4.50]], and there is लोप (elision) of the final consonant of these words, if they end in a consonant.
