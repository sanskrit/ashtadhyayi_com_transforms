sutra: नाम्रेडितस्यान्त्यस्य तु वा

---
When a word which is used to imitate some abstract sound and which ends is the phrase 'अत्' and which is also an आम्रेडितसंज्ञक is followed by the word 'इति', then the 'अत्' of the previous word and the इ of इति are not combined as mentioned in the previous rule 'अव्यक्तानुकरणस्यात इतौ'. Instead, the त् and इ optionally combine to form a पररूप-एकादेश.
