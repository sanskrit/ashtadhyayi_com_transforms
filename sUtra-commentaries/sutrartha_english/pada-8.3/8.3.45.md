sutra: नित्यं समासेऽनुत्तरपदस्थस्य

---
While doing a समास, the विसर्ग of the इस्/उस्-प्रत्यय when followed by a letter from कवर्ग or पवर्ग is always converted to a षकार whenever the words involved in the समास are associated with each other. However, if the पूर्वपद of this समास is a समास on its own, then the षत्व is completely prohibited.
