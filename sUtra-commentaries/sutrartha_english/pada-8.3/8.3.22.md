In the context of संहिता, all the grammarians say that the normal यकार as well as the लघु-उच्चारण-यकार is removed when it is followed by a हल्-letter, provided that such a यकार occurs at end of a पद and comes after the letter अ , or if such a यकार occurs at the end of the words भोस्, भगोस्, or अघोस्.
