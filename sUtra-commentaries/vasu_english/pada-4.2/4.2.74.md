sutra: उदक् च विपाशः

---
This debars अण्; and it applies to all words whether polysyllabic or not. Thus दात्तः "a well completed by <i>Datta</i>", गौप्तः &c.



Why do we say on the "northern bank"? Because if a well is situate on the southern bank of the river <i>Vipasa</i>, then the affix अण् will apply as दात्तः and गौप्तः, the difference being in the accent. This <i>sutra</i> illustrates the refined distinctions drawn by the author, and the importance attached to accents in former times.
