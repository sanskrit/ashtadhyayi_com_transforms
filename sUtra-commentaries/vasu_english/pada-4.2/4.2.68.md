sutra: तेन निर्वृत्तम्

---
The phrase देशे तन्नाम्नि of the last <i>sutra</i> governs this and the two subsequent <i>sutras</i>. By these four <i>sutras</i> the names of countries are formed from various substantives. Thus कुशाम्बेन निर्वृत्ता = कौशाम्बी नगरी  "the city of <i>Kausambi</i>, completed by <i>Kusamba</i>". Similarly साहस्री परिखा "a mote completed by a thousand (gold coins) or persons". A place is named after the means or the person, by which or through whom it is established.
