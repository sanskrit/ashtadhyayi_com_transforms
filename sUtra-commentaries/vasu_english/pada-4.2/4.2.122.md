sutra: प्रस्थपुरवहान्ताच्च

This debars छ [[4.2.114]]. Thus मालाप्रस्थकः, नान्दीपुरकः, कान्तिपुरकः, पैलुवहकः, फाल्गुनीवहकः ॥



The words ending in पुर would have taken the affix वुञ् by the next <i>sutra</i> also, but as that <i>sutra</i> is restricted to the countries of the East, this <i>sutra</i> is general in its scope.
