index: 4.2.96
sutra: कुलकुक्षिग्रीवाभ्यः श्वास्यलंकारेषु

The force of the affix, as already told above, is to denote 'produce' &c. [[4.3.25]] &c)): but the whole word has specific significance. As कौलेयकः = a dog (lit. pertaining to a family); कौक्षेयकः = a sword (lit. remaining in a sheath), ग्रैवेयकः = a necklace. When not having these meanings; the regular derivatives from these words are formed by अण् as, कौलः, कौक्षः and ग्रैवः ॥
