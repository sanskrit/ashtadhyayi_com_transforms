sutra: भृशादिभ्यो भुव्यच्वेर्लोपश्च हलः

Thus, अभृशो भृशो भवति = भृशायते 'he becomes much (from a little)'; शीघ्रायते 'he becomes swift (from being tardy)'. All these roots will be <i>Atmanepadi</i> [[1.3.12]].



The phrase अच्वेः 'not ending in the adverbial affix ई', refers to every one of the words belonging to the class भ्रिशादि. It may be objected, what was the necessity of adding this condition, since the affix च्वि itself denotes that something has become what it was not before; and therefore a word which has taken the affix च्वि, will not again take क्यङ् in that very sense. The repetition of च्वि here shows that the words भृश् &c. never take the affix च्वि, in the sense of 'something becoming what it was not before'. Thus the present <i>sutra</i> is an exception to <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.50]] which ordains च्वि.
