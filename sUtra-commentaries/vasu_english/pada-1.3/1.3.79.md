index: 1.3.79
sutra: अनुपराभ्यां कृञः

By aphorism [[1.3.32]] <i>ante</i>, the root कृ took the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> when the sense denoted was that of "divulging, reviling," &c., and it also took <i>Atmanepada</i> termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent by virtue of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]], because the root कृञ् has an indicatory ञ. The present <i>sutra</i> makes an exception to those rules, and ordains <i>parasmaipada</i>. Thus अनुकरोति 'he imitates,' पराकरोति 'he does well.'
