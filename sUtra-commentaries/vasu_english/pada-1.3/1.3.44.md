The root <i>jna</i> which ordinarily means 'to know' and is <i>parasmaipadi</i> by rule [[1.3.78]], becomes <i>Atmanepadi</i> when through the virtue of any prefix it means 'to deceive:' as अपजानीते 'he deceives,' शतमपजानीते 'he denies the debt of a hundred rupees,' सहस्रमपजानीते 'denies a thousand.'



Why do we say when meaning "to deny ?" Observe:- न त्वं किंचिदपि ज्ञानासि 'thou knowest not anything.'
