index: 1.3.81
sutra: प्राद्वहः

The root वह to carry is <i>svaritet</i>, and by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]] it would have taken the <i>Atmanepada</i> termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. But the present <i>sutra</i> ordains <i>parasmaipada</i> instead. As प्रवहति 'it flows.'



Why do we say "when coming after <i>pra</i>"? Because after any other preposition it will not take <i>parasmaipada</i>, as आवहते 'he brings.'
