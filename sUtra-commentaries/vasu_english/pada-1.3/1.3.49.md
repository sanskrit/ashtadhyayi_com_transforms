As अनुवदते कठः कलापस्य <i>katha</i> is echoing or imitates <i>kalapa</i>. He reutters exactly what the <i>kalapa</i>-reader or the teacher says. The word <i>anu</i> here means similarly.



Why do we say 'in the Intransitive'? Because when it is used in the transitive it takes the affixes of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>. As पूर्वमेव यजुरुदितमनुवदति, 'he repeats the <i>yajurveda</i> which he had learned before.'



The words 'uttering of articulate speech' are understood here also. Otherwise अनुवदति वीणा 'the lute resounds,' here it is <i>Parasmaipada</i>.
