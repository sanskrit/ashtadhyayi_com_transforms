index: 1.3.73
sutra: अपाद्वदः

---
The phrase "when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent," is understood here. The <i>sutra</i> is clear. As धनकामो न्यायमपवदते 'the wealth-seeker forsakes justice,' that is to say, he wishes to acquire wealth at the sacrifice of justice. But when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the <i>parasmaipada</i> is employed. As अपवदति.
