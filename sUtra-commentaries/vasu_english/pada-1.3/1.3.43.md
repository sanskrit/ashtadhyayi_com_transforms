index: 1.3.43
sutra: अनुपसर्गाद्वा

---
The root '<i>kram</i>' may always be conjugated as <i>Atmanepadi</i> when not having any <i>upasarga</i>. The <i>upasarga</i> will be defined in [[1.4.59]]. The option allowed by this <i>sutra</i> is an example of what is technically known as <i>aprapta</i> <i>vibhasa</i> viz., an option which is not an alternative limitation to a general rule already found or known.



Examples: क्रमते or क्रामति 'he goes over.' Why do we say 'when it is without any preposition ?' For no option is allowed when it takes preposition. As संक्रामति.
