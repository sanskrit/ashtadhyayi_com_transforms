sutra: यथामुखसंमुखस्य दर्शनः खः

---
The word दर्शनः means that in which something is seen, such as, looking glass, mirror &c, which reflect things. The word यथामुख is an <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound, the meaning of यथा being that of likeness [[2.1.6]]. Thus यथामुखं दर्शनः = यथामुखीनः 'showing or reflecting the likeness of the face' — a  mirror. सर्वस्य मुखस्य दर्शनः = सम्मुखीनः 'showing or reflecting the whole face' - a looking-glass.
