index: 5.2.57
sutra: नित्यं शतादिमासार्धमाससंवत्सराच्च

---
The words शतादय are numerals. The words मास &c, are not numerals; they would not have taken डट्, but by the implication of this <i>sutra</i>. Thus शतस्य पूरणः = शततमः 'hundreth'; सहस्रतमः, लक्षतमः ॥ Similarly मासस्य पूरणः = मासतमो दिवसः 'the last day of the month'. अर्द्धमासतमः, संवत्सरतमः ॥



By the next <i>Sutra</i> [[5.2.58]], the words शत &c, would also have taken तमट्; but the scope of that <i>sutra</i> is confined to numerals not preceded by another numeral. There is no such restriction here. Hence we have एकशततमः, द्विशततमः ॥
