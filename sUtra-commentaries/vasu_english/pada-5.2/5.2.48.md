sutra: तस्य पूरणे डट्

---
That by which a thing is completed is called पूरण ॥ Thus एकादशानां पूरणः = एकादशः the "eleventh" (i. e. the one which, added to ten, completes the eleven). Similarly त्रयोदशः ॥ By this affix, ordinals are formed. The rule therefore, does not apply to a case like this:- पंचानां मुष्टिकानां पूरणो घटः ॥
