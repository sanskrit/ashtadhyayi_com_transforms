Thus गीः, धूः, पूः, आशीः ॥ These are all examples of roots ending in र् ॥ Of roots ending in व्, examples will be given in the next <i>sutra</i>.



Why have we used the word 'penultimate'? Observe अबिभर् भवान्, here the इ of the reduplicative syllable is not to be lengthened.



Why do we say 'of इक् vowels'? So that the अ of भ in the above example अबिभर् may not be lengthened.



The word धातोः 'of a root' is understood here also. Therefore इ and उ are not lengthened in अग्निः, वायुः ॥



The word पदस्य is understood here also, therefore, not here, गिरौ, गिरः ॥
