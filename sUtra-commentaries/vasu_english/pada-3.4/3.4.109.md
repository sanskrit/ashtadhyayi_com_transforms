index: 3.4.109
sutra: सिजभ्यस्तविदिभ्यः च

---
This applies to tenses having ङ् other than that of लिङ्, namely, the लङ् and लुङ् ।



सिच् is employed in forming the first Aorist. The reduplicated verbs, as well as the verb विद्, form their third person plural in जुस्, in the tenses other than लिङ्, and those that take सिच् । The word ङितः of <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.99]], is understood here also; and therefore this rule is restricted to the Imperfect (लङ्) of the reduplicated verb. Thus of सिच्, we have अकार्षुः, अहार्षः । Similarly, after the Imperfect of the reduplicated verbs, we have अविभयुः, अजिहयुः, अजागरुः । In the case of विद्, we have अविदुः ।
