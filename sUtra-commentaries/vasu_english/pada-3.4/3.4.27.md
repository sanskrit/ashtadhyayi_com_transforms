When is the non-employment of कृञ् valid ? When the same sentence will remain correct by omitting कृ, i. e. when without employing it, the same idea will be expressed. Thus अन्यथाकारं, एवङ्कारं, कथङ्कारं or इत्थङ्कारं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats otherwise, he eats so, how does he eat, or he eats thus'. In fact, the sentence अन्यथाकारं भुङ्क्ते is equivalent to अन्यथा भुङ्क्ते ।



Why do we say 'if the non-employment would be valid'? Witness अन्यथा कृत्वा शिरो भुङ्क्ते 'he eats, having turned his head aside'. Here कृञ् could not be spared.
