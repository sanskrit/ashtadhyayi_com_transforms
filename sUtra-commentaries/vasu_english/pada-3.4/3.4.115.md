This debars them from being called <i>sarvadhatuka</i> and, being <i>ardhadhatuka</i>, some of them take the augment इट्; as पेचिथ, शेकिथ । Moreover by their being <i>ardhadhatuka</i> they do not admit of the <i>Vikaranas</i> शप् &c.



So from ग्लै (ग्ला, VI. 1. 45) we have जग्ले; here the आ is elided by [[6.4.64]], the affix being treated as <i>ardhadhatuka</i>; similarly मम्ले from म्लै ।
