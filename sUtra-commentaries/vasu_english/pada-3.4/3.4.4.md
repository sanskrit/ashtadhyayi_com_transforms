sutra: यथाविध्यनुप्रयोगः पूर्वस्मिन्

The examples have already been given under <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.2]]. We cannot say लूनीहि लुनीहीत्येवायं छिनत्ति; we must use a verb from the root लू 'to cut'. Such as लुनाति, &c. So also अधीष्वाधीष्व takes अधोते only after it and not a synonymous verb like पठति &c.
