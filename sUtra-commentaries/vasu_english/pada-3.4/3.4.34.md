sutra: निमूलसमूलयोः कषः

---
Thus निमूलकाषं कषति 'he scrapes down to the roots'; समूलकाषं कषति 'he scrapes up to the roots'. In fact, the gerund of the root and the root itself denote the same thing; the whole sentence निमूलकाषङ्कषति being equal to निमूलं कषति. From this <i>sutra</i> up to <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.46]], the subsequent verb governing the previous word, must be derived from the same root from which the gerund is derived; see <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.46]].
