sutra: टित आत्मनेपदानां टेरे

---
The ल or the tense-affixes that have an indicatory ट् are six:- लट्, लिट्, लुट्, लृट्, लोट्, लेट् । In these tenses the final portion called टि of the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes is changed into ए । Thus त becomes ते, आताम् becomes आते, झ becomes झे &c, as shown in the foregoing table.



The affixes शानच्, and कानच् are also <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes. Why are not their finals changed into ए as in पचमानः, यजमानः? Because the word आत्मनेपदानां in the <i>sutra</i> refers by context to the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes included in the <i>Pratyahara</i> तिङ् ।
