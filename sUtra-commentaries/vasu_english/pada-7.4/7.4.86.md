Thus जंजप्यते and जंजपीति; जंजभ्यते and जंजभीति, दंदह्यते and दंदहीति; दंदश्यते and दंदशीति ॥ The root is दंश्, but it is exhibited in the <i>sutra</i> as दश, showing that even in यङ् लुक्, the root loses its nasal. Similarly बंभज्यते and बंभजीति, and पंपश्यते and पंपशीति ॥ This last is a <i>sautra</i> root.
