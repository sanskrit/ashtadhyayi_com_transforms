index: 7.4.24
sutra: एतेर्लिङि

As उदियात्, समियात्, अन्वियात् ॥ This is an exception to the following <i>sutra</i> by which a long would have been substituted. But ईयात् without a Preposition. The अण् [[7.4.13]] is understood here also. Therefore ए form of इ will not be shortened, as आ + इयात् = एयात्, समेयात् ॥
