Thus अनजः, अनश्वः, अनुष्ट्रः ॥ Why do we use तस्मात् "after such a नञ्"? Otherwise नुट् would have been the augment of नञ्, and not of the subsequent word for: the <i>sutra</i> would have read thus नुडाचि ॥ Adding नुट् to नञ् or rather to अ, we have अन् (granting that नुट् is not to be added before अ but after it, against (I. I. 46)). Now अन् + अजः will be अन्रजः and not अनजः for [[8.3.32]] will cause the doubling of the final न of अन् ॥ Hence to prevent this contingency, नुट् is ordained with regard to the second member and not with regard to अ or नञ् ॥
