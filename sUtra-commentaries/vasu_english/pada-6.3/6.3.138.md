Thus दधीचः पश्य, दधीचा, दधीचे, मधूचः पश्य, मधूचा, मधूचे ॥ The nasal of अञ्च is elided by [[6.4.24]], and the अ by [[6.4.138]]. In दधि + अच् the इ is not changed to its semivowel, though that is an <i>antaranga</i> rule, because the present <i>sutra</i> ordains specifically long ई, and so also दधी + अच् and मधू + अच् ॥ See also [[6.3.92]].
