sutra: आनङ् ऋतो द्वन्द्वे

Thus होतापोतारौ, नेष्टोद्गातारौ, प्रशास्ताप्रतिहर्त्तारौ मातापितरौ, याताननान्दरौ ॥ The substitute is really आ, the न् is useful only to prevent the application of [[1.1.51]], by which a र comes after every simple vowel substitute of ऋ ॥



Why do we say 'both words ending in ऋ'? Observe पितृपितामहौ ॥ The <i>anuvritti</i> of पुत्र is understood here, so that the ऋ of the first member is changed to आ before पुत्र also, though it does not end in ऋ. As पितापुत्रौ, मातापुत्रौ ॥
