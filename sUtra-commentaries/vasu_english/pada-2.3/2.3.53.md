index: 2.3.53
sutra: कृञः प्रतियत्ने

Ex. एधोदकस्योपस्कुरुते 'the wood gives a new quality to the water' (or he prepares the wood and water for sacrifice). (By [[6.1.139]], स is inserted).



When प्रतियत्न is not meant, the second case-affix is employed: as कटं करोति.



The word शेष is also understood here. So that we have also एधोदकमुपस्कुरुते ॥
