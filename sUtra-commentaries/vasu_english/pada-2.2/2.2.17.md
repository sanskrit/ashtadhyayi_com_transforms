sutra: नित्यं क्रीडाजीविकयोः

This is a Nitya-samasa incapable of analysis. This anuvritti of the word 'na' which began with <i>sútra</i> 10, does not extend further. The affix तृच्  never has the sense of sporting or livelihood; the only examples possible are of '<i>aka</i>.' Thus उद्दालकपुष्पभजिका 'a sort of game played by the people in the eastern districts in which <i>uddalaka</i> flowers are broken or crushed.' So also वारणपुष्पप्रचायिका 'a play of gathering flowers.'



So also दन्तलेखकः 'one who earns his bread by painting or marking the teeth.' नखलेखक 'a nail-painter by profession.'



Why do we say 'when meaning sporting or livelihood.' Observe ओदनस्य भोजकः.
