sutra: वनं पुरगामिश्रकासिध्रकाशारिकाकोटराऽग्रेभ्यः

---
The words पूर्वपदात् and संज्ञायाम् of the last <i>sutra</i>, are to be read into this aphorism. Thus पुरगावणम्, मिश्रकावणम्, सिध्रकावणं, कोटरावणम्, अग्रेवणम् [[2.2.31]] शारिकावणम् ॥



The lengthening of the finals in the above is by [[6.3.117]]. Though the word अग्रेवणं is not a Name, yet the rule [[6.3.9]], applies to it and the case-affix is not elided, because it is so read in <i>Rajadantadi</i> list [[2.2.31]].



The substitution of ण for न would have taken place by the preceding rule. The separate enunciation of the rule with regard to the word वन, shows that this is a restrictive or नियम rule. The न of वन is changed into ण, when preceded by these words only and no other. Thus कुबेरवनं, शतधारवनम्, असिपत्रवनम् ॥
