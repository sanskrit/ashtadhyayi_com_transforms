If the second part of a compound contains a letter of the class क्, the change is obligatory, even though the second part be not monosyllabic. As वस्त्रयुगिणौ, वस्त्रयुगिणः, स्वर्गकामिणौ, वृषगामिणौ ॥ नुम् :- वस्त्रयुगाणि, खरयुगाणि ॥ विभक्ति :- वस्त्रयुगेण, खरयुगेण ॥



The word वस्त्रयुगिणौ is a compound of वस्त्र with युगिन् (the affix इनिis added first to युग and then the word so formed is compounded with <i>vastra</i>). Thus the न् becomes प्रातिपदिकान्त i.e. it becomes the final of a Nominal-stem, which stands as a second member in a compound.
