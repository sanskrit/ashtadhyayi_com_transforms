index: 4.3.39
sutra: प्रायभवः

---
The word प्रायः means something less than all i. e. abundant. Thus स्रौघ्नः 'what is abundant or mostly to be found in <i>Srughna</i>', = स्रुघ्ने प्रायेण बाहुल्येन भवति. So also माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः &c.



This <i>sutra</i> may appear to be superfluous as being covered by the more comprehensive sutra तत्रभवः [[4.3.53]]. If प्रायभवः be explained as अनित्यभवः i. e. what sometimes is to be found and sometimes not, still it will make little difference.
