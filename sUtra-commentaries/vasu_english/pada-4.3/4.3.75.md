sutra: ठगायस्थानेभ्यः

---
The word आय means what is the share appropriated by the lord. The source of आय is called आयस्थान ॥



This debars अण् and छ ॥ Thus शौल्कशालिकः 'what is derived from custom house'. आकरिकम् 'revenue derived from mines'.



The plural in the <i>sutra</i> prevents <i>Svarupavidhi</i> [[1.1.68]].
