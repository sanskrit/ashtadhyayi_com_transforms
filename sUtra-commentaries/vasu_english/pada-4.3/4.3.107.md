index: 4.3.107
sutra: कठचरकाल्लुक्

---
The word कठ would have taken णिनि as it is a वैशम्पायनान्तेवासी word: and चरक would have taken the affix अण् ॥ Both are elided. Thus कठाः 'who study the <i>Chhandas</i> enounced by <i>Katha</i>'. चरकाः &c.



The word '<i>Chhandas</i>' qualifies this <i>sutra</i>. Observe काठाः चारकाः श्लोकाः ॥
