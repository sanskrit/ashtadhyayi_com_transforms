sutra: उपज्ञाते

---
Knowledge acquired by oneself without being taught is called उपज्ञातं, i.e. an intuition or self taught knowledge. Thus पाणिनिनोपज्ञातं = पाणिनीयम् अकालकं व्याकरणं 'the law of Grammar discovered by <i>Panini</i>'. So also काशकृत्स्नम् गुरुलाघवम्, आपिशलम् दुष्करणम् ॥ Compare [[2.4.21]]. The <i>Panini</i>'s Grammar is called अकालकं as it does not define काल or tenses; गुरुलाघव is the name of the sciences of wealth (यत्रोपायाणां गौरवं लाघवं चिन्त्यते) ॥ The word <i>Duskarana</i> is the name of a Grammar, so-called because of the technical term दुषू occurring in it. Some say it means कामशास्त्रः ॥
