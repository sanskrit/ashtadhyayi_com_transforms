sutra: अणिनुणः

---
By [[3.3.44]], the affix इनुण् is added to a root to express a condition resulting from a universal co-operation of the action denoted by the root. But a word formed by इनुण् is after all an imaginary word, it requires the further addition of this affx अण् to make it a complete word. In fact, all <i>svartha</i> affixes generally complete the not fully developed word. Thus सांराविणम् वर्त्तते, सांकूटिनम् ॥
