index: 5.4.51
sutra: अरुर्मनश्चक्षुश्चेतोरहोरजसां लोपश्च

The affix च्वि would have come after these words by force of the last <i>sutra</i> which is of universal application : the present <i>sutra</i> is made in order to teach the elision of the consonant. Thus अनरुररुः सम्पद्यते, तं करोति = अरू करोति, अरू भवति, अरू स्यात् ॥ So also उन्मनी करोति, भवति or स्यात्, so also उच्चक्षू, विचेती, विरही, and विरजी करोति or भवति or स्यात् ॥ The short उ of अरु and चक्षु is lengthened by [[7.4.26]], and the अ of the other words is changed into ई by [[7.4.32]].
