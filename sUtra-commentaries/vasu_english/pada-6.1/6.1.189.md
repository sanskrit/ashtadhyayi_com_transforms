Thus द꣡दति, द꣡दतु, द꣡धति, द꣡धतु, ज꣡क्षति, ज꣡क्षतुः, जा꣡ग्रति, जा꣡ग्रतुः ॥ Before consonant affixes: दद्या꣡त् ॥ Before सेट् affixes :- जक्षितः꣡ ॥ Though the word आदि was understood here from the last aphorism, the repetition is for the sake of making this an invariable rule and not an optional rule as those in the foregoing.
