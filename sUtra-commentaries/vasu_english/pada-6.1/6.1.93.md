index: 6.1.93
sutra: औतोऽम्शसोः

---
The word औतः is a compound of आ + ओतः ॥ Thus गौ - अम्, = गाम्, गो + अस् = गाः ॥ Thus गां पश्य, गाः पश्यः ॥ This debars the <i>Vriddhi</i> of (VII. I. 90). So also द्यो or द्याः पश्य; as the word द्यो is also a nominal stem ending in ओ ॥ The <i>Sarvanamasthana</i> affixes are णित् after this word also (see [[7.1.90]]) which would have caused <i>Vriddhi</i>, therefore, this आ debars the <i>Vriddhi</i>. The word अम् here means the affix of the Accusative Singular, as it is read in connection with the case-affix शस्, and as the word सुप् of the last <i>sutra</i> governs this also. Therefore अम् the verbal Tense-affix of the Imperfect is not meant: thus we have अचिनवम्, असुनवम् ॥
