sutra: आशितः कर्ता

Thus आ꣡शितो देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i>, having eaten'. Here it is used as an active participle. The क्त is added to अश् preceded by आ, to form both Active and Passive Participles : which by [[6.2.144]] would have taken acute on the final. This debars that. In the Passive Participle we have आशित꣡म् देवदत्तेन 'eaten by <i>Devadatta</i>'. आशित꣡मन्नम् 'the eaten food'. The former is भावे क्त, the second is कर्मणि क्त ॥
