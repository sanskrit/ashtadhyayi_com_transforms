sutra: कॄ धान्ये

---
The verb कॄ here means 'to scatter', and not 'to injure', because no words formed by this affix are found in Sanskrit in that sense.



As उत्कारो धान्यस्य 'the winnowing of corn'; निकारो धान्यस्य  the winnowing of corn'. But when not referring to grain, we have भैक्षवोत्करः 'a heap of alms', पुष्पनिकरः 'the essence or heap of flowers'.
