sutra: ड्वितः क्त्रिः

The phrases 'when the sense is that of mere action', and 'when the sense is that of an appellative, the word being related to the verb from which its name is deduced, but not as agent', are of course understood in this, as in all the previous aphorisms. Then by [[4.4.20]], (of the affix क्ति, मप् is always the augment) we must add म, for we can not use the affix त्रि alone; but we must always use त्रिम. Thus डुपचष् to cook--पक्तिमम् 'what is ripe'; डुवप्--उपत्रिमम् 'sown' (VI. I. 15); डुकृञ्--कृत्रिमम् 'artificial'.
