sutra: भावेऽनुपसर्गस्य

As हवः 'calling'; हवे हवे सुहवं शूरमिन्द्रम् ।



Why do we say 'when no <i>upasarga</i> is in composition with it'? Observe आह्वायः । Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word भाव was understood in this aphorism from <i>sutra</i> 18, its repetition here shows that the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>sutra</i> 19. which was running, must not be taken; so that this word applies to agent-<i>karaka</i> also.
