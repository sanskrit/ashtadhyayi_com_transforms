index: 3.3.98
sutra: व्रजयजोर्भावे क्यप्

---
The affix क्यप् comes after a roots 1. व्रज 'to go' 2. यज् 'to worship' acutely accented (उदात्त) in forming a word in the feminine denoting action.

This supersedes क्तिन्. Thus व्रज्या 'wandering about'; इज्या [[6.1.15]] 'worshipping'. The प् of क्यप् is indicatory, and though it serves no purpose in this <i>sutra</i>, it is, however, necessary in the next, for it is by force of क्यप् having प् that we add a त by (VI 1. 71), in the words formed in the next aphorism.
