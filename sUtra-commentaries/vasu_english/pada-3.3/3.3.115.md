index: 3.3.115
sutra: ल्युट् च

---
Thus हसनं छात्रस्य 'the laughter of the student'; शोभनं 'beauty'; जल्पनं 'speech'; शयनं 'sleep'; आसनम् 'seat'.



The separation of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, in which it might well have been included, is for the sake of the subsequent aphorisms, in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>lyut</i> only runs, and not that of क्त ।
