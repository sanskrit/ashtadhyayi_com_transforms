sutra: कर्मण्यधिकरणे च

As जलधिः 'the ocean (in which water is held)';  शरधिः 'a quiver (that in which arrows are put)'.



The word 'location' in the aphorism indicates that the words so formed should have no other significance. The word च in the aphorism draws in the affix कि from the last <i>sutra</i>.
