sutra: खनो घ च

The affix घञ् has been read into the <i>sutra</i> by force of the word च । Thus आखानः or आखनः 'a spade, a hoe'.



Vart:- The affix ड also comes in this sense after the verb खन्. Thus आखन् + ड = आखः 'a spade'. The indicatory ड् showing that the final portion called टि should be elided.



Vart:- The affix डर also comes in the same sense; as आखरः 'a spade'.



Vart:- So also the affix इक्ः; as आखनिकः 'a spade'.

 

Vart:- So too the affix इकवक as आखनिकवकः 'a spade'.
