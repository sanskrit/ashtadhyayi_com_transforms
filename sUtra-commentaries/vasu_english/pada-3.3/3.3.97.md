index: 3.3.97
sutra: ऊतियूतिजूतिसातिहेतिकीर्तयश्च

---
The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word मन्त्रे does not exist in this; but the word उदात्त of the last syllable is understood here. The word ऊति is thus formed :- अव् 'to protect' + क्तिन् = ऊ + तिः [[6.4.20]] = ऊतिः । this form is regular and could be evolved from <i>sutra</i> 94 also; but not so the accent. The irregularity in पूतिः and जूतिः consists in the lengthening of उ into ऊ; in सातिः the आ of the root सै which becomes सा by (VI. I 45), is not changed into इ, as rule [[7.4.40]] required, and this is the irregularity. This form may also be derived from the root सन् with perfect propriety, except as to the accent which would be regulated by the present <i>sutra</i>: thus सन् + क्तिन् = सा + क्तिन् [[6.4.42]] साति. The form हेति may by derived either from हन् or हिनोति ।
