sutra: अवे ग्रहो वर्षप्रतिबन्धे

The word 'optionally' is understood here. The word वर्षप्रतिबन्ध means the absence of rain, from some cause or another, when the season has arrived; as अवग्राहः or अवग्रहो देवस्य 'the draught of rain'.



Why do we say 'when meaning obstruction of rain'? Observe अवग्रहः पदस्य ।
