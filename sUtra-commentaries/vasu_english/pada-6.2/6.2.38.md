sutra: महान् व्रीह्यपराह्णगृष्टीष्वासजाबालभारभारतहैलिहिलरौरवप्रवृद्धेषु

Thus महा꣡व्रीहिः, महा꣡पराह्णः, महा꣡गृष्टिः, महे꣡ष्वासः, महा꣡जाबालः, महा꣡भारः, महा꣡भारतः, महा꣡हैलिहलः, महा꣡रौरवः, महा꣡प्रवृद्धः ॥ The महत् has acute on the final. (<i>Unadi</i> II. 84) On the प्रतिपदोक्त maxim already mentioned under [[6.2.26]], this accent will apply to that compound of महत् which it forms under rule [[2.1.61]], for that is the particular rule of <i>Karmadharaya</i> compounding relating to <i>mahat</i> (<i>pratipadokta</i>). This rule therefore, will not apply to Genitive <i>Tatpurusha</i>. Thus महतो व्रीहिः = महद्व्रीहिः꣡ which has accent on the final by (VI. I. 223).



Q. The word प्रवृद्ध is a Participle formed by  क्त affix, and by rule [[6.2.46]], in a <i>Karmadharaya</i> compound, the first member will retain its original accent. What is then the necessity of reading this word in this <i>sutra</i>? Ans. That <i>sutra</i> [[6.2.46]] applies, on the maxim of <i>pradipadokta</i>, to the special participles and nouns mentioned in [[2.1.59]] and not to every participle and noun.
