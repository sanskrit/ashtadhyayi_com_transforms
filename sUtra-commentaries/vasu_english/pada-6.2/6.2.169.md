Thus प्रक्षालितमुखः꣡ or प्रक्षालित꣡मुखः or प्र꣡क्षालितमुखः ॥ When the final is not acute, then Rule [[6.2.110]] applies which makes the first member have acute on the final optionally, and when that also does not apply, then by [[6.2.1]] the first member preserves its original accent, which is that of the <i>gati</i> [[6.2.49]]. Thus there are three forms. So also with a word denoting comparison:- सिंहमुखः꣡ or सिंह꣡मुखः, व्याघ्रमुखः꣡ or व्याघ्र꣡मुखः ॥
