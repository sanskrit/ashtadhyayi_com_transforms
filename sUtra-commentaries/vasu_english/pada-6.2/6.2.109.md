sutra: नदी बन्धुनि

Thus गार्गी꣡बन्धुः, वात्सी꣡बन्धुः ॥ The words गा꣡र्गी and वा꣡त्सी are formed by adding ङीष् [[4.1.16]] to गार्ग्य and वात्स्य ending in यञ् [[4.1.105]], and therefore, they are first acute. By [[6.2.1]] this accent would have been retained, but for the present <i>sutra</i>. Why do we say "a <i>Nadi</i> (Feminine in ई) word"? Observe ब्र꣡ह्मबन्धुः, the word ब्रह्म has acute on the first syllable as it is formed by मनिन् (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 146) and it retains that accent [[6.2.1]]. Why do we say "before बन्धु"? Observe गा꣡र्गीप्रियः ॥
