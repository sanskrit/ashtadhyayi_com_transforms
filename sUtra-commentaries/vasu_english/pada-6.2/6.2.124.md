Thus सौशमिक꣡न्थम्, आह्वरक꣡न्थम्, चप्यक꣡न्थम् ॥ The word सौशमिः denotes the descendant of सुशमः (शोभनः शमो यस्य) आह्वर is formed by the preposition आ with the verb ष्ठ्वृ and the affix क [[3.1.136]] The compound is Neuter by [[3.4.20]]. These are Genitive compounds. When the word is not Neuter we have दाक्षिकन्था ॥
