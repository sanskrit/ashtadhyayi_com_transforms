sutra: गोतन्तियवं पाले

Thus गो꣡पालः, त꣡न्तिपालः, य꣡वपालः ॥ The word तन्ति is the rope with which calves are tied. (तनु विस्तारे + क्तिच्). This applies to words not denoting a functionary, which would be governed by [[6.2.75]]. Why do we say गो &c? Observe वत्सपालः꣡ ॥ Why do we say 'followed by पाल'? Observe गोरक्षः꣡ ॥
