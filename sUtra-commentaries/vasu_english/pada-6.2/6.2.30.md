This allows option where the last rule required the accent necessarily. Thus बह्व॑रत्निः or बह्वरत्निः, बहु꣡मास्यः or बहुमास्यः꣡, बहु꣡कपालः or बहुकपालः꣡, बहु꣡भगालः or बहुभगालः꣡, बहु꣡शरावः or बहुशरावः꣡ ॥ The word बहु꣡ has acute on the final being formed by the affix कु (<i>Unadi</i> I. 29). When the उ is changed to व्, as in the first example, the <i>anudatta</i> अ is changed into <i>svarita</i> by _VIII. 2. 4): when the first member preserves its accent. In the other alternative, the accent falls on the last syllable.
