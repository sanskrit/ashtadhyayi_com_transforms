As अभ्यर्णा सेना, अभ्यर्णा शरत् ॥ Why' when meaning near'? See अभ्यर्दितो वृषलः शीतेन meaning पीडितः ॥ विदूरं means 'remote,' that which is not remote is अविदूरं

'non-remote', the state of being non-remote is आविदूर्यम् 'non-remote-ness.' The affix यक् is added irregularly, in spite of the prohibition contained in [[5.1.121]].
