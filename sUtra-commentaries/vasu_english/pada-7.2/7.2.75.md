Thus चिकरिषति, जिगरिषति, दिदरिषते, दिधरिषते, पिप्रच्छिषति [[1.2.8]]; (VI. I. 16). But सिसृक्षति not included in the five. The roots कॄ and गॄ would have optionally got इट् in the desiderative by [[7.2.41]], which would have been optionally lengthened by [[7.2.38]]. But the इट् here being specifically ordained, does not get lengthened by [[7.2.38]].
