As अदेवीत्, असेवीत्, अकोषीत्, अमोषीत्, but अलावीत् where the root ends in a vowel. Will not लू by taking <i>Guna</i> (which is an <i>antaranga</i> operation) and the substitution of अव्, become a root ending in a consonant? No, though <i>Guna</i> is <i>antaranga</i>, it is superseded by the express <i>Vriddhi</i>.
