index: 3.2.17
sutra: भिक्षासेनादायेषु च

The <i>anuvritti</i> of the words 'in the locative case' does not extend to this aphorism, and hence the necessity of making a distinct and separate <i>sutra</i>.



Thus भिक्षाचरः 'a beggar' (who goes for alms); सेनाचरः 'one who goes with an army'; आदायचरः 'one who goes after having taken'.
