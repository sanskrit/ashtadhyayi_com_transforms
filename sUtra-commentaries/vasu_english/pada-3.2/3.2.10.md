sutra: वयसि च

---
In this <i>sutra</i> the verb हृञ् has the sense of <i>udyamana</i> which was specifically excluded in the last. The word वयस् means the condition of human body as dependent upon time. This rule applies to those words which indicate the attainment of appropriate age for the accomplishment of objects described by the <i>upapada</i>, or the reaching of that age in which the thing described by the <i>upapada</i> naturally takes place; as अस्थिहरः श्वा 'the dog that has reached the age when it can chew bones' (lit. when it can raise it up); कवचहरः क्षत्रियकुमारः 'the <i>Kshatriya</i> boy old enough to wear (lit. 'to raise up or bear') the shield'; so that the verb here has the sense of 'raising up'.
