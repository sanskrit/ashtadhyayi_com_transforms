index: 3.2.34
sutra: मितनखे च

---
The aphorism has its scope when the words formed do not denote measures, which was the case in the last <i>sutra</i>. Thus मितम्पचा ब्राह्ममणी 'the <i>Brahmani</i> who cooks a little i. e. niggardly <i>Brahmani</i>'; नखम्पचा यवागूः 'the nail-scorching barley gruel'.
