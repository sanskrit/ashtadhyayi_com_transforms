sutra: कृञो हेतुताच्छील्यानुलोम्येषु

---
The word हेतु of this <i>sutra</i> means the final or conclusive cause, and is not the grammatical हेतु meaning agent. ताच्छील्य means habit, and literally, the act of being accustomed to that. आनुलोम्य comes from अनुलोम meaning 'with the hair', that is to say, regular, in natural order, successive, and hence favourable, and agreeable complaisance, acquiescence &c. Of हेतु, we have  शोककरी कन्या 'the daughter that causes sorrow'; यशस्करी विद्या 'honorable science'; कुलकरं धनं 'the family making wealth'. Of ताच्छील्य, we have श्राद्धकरः 'who performs obsequies'; अर्थकरः 'who amasses wealth'. Of आनुलोम्य, we have प्रैषकरः 'who promptly does what he is directed'; वचनकरः 'who regularly does what he is told'.

 

Why do we say 'when having these senses'? Otherwise the affix will be अण्. As कुम्भकारः 'potter', नगरकारः 'city-maker'.
