sutra: अनुदात्तेतश्च हलादेः

---
As वर्त्तनः 'being'; वर्द्धनः 'growing'.



Why do we say '<i>Anudattet</i>'? Observe भविता.



Why do we say 'beginning with a consonant'? Observe एधिता, which though <i>Atmanepadi</i>, takes तृन्.



Why have we used the term आदि 'beginning' in the <i>sutra</i>? Observe जुगुप्सनः 'censuring'; मीमांसनः 'an investigator'. For without the word आदि, the rule would have stood thus:- अनुदात्तेतश्च हलः which by (I. I. 72.) would mean 'the affix युच् comes after the verbs which end with a consonant'; so that even after एध् we shall have युच्; and there would be no युच् after जुगुप्स which ends with a vowel.



This rule will not apply if the root is transitive; as वसिता वस्त्रं ।
