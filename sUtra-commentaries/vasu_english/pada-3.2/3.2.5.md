sutra: तुन्दशोकयोः परिमृजापनुदोः

---
As तुन्द परिमृज आस्ते 'he lay lazy'. So also शोकापनुदः पुत्रो जातः 'a son, destroyer of sorrow is born'.



Vart:- This affix is to be applied only then, when the meaning of the word to be formed is 'lazy' and 'giver of happiness'.



Vart:- The epithet तुन्द परिमृजः is applied to a lazy person; while तुन्द परिमार्जः means who clears his navel. So शोकापनुदः means giver of happiness, while शोकापनोदः means 'removal of sorrow'.



Vart:- The words मूलविभुजः 'a chariot' and the rest should be included in the subdivision of words formed by the affix क. The words belonging to this head can only be recognised by their form, there being no list of them to be found anywhere. Thus मूलविभुजः 'a chariot', नखमुचः 'a bow', काकगुह 'sesamums', कुमुदम् (कौ मोदते) 'a lotus'.
