Thus उष्ट्र इव क्रोशति = उष्ट्रक्रोशिन् 'who makes a noise like a camel'; ध्वाङ्क्षराविन् 'who makes a noise like a crow'.



This <i>sutra</i> applies where 'habit' is not indicated : or where 'genus' is denoted in opposition to the last aphorism.



Why do we say 'when expressing the agent'? Witness as अपूपानिव भक्षयति माषान् 'he eats <i>masha</i> like <i>apupa</i>'. Here अपूपा is object and not agent, and hence no composition takes place.



Why do we say 'denoting a standard of comparison'? Otherwise there will be no composition. As उष्ट्रः क्रोशति 'the camel makes noise'. For the accents of these words, see [[6.2.80]].
