index: 3.2.6
sutra: प्रे दाज्ञः

We applied by <i>sutra</i> 3 the affix क after verbs that ended in long आ and had no <i>upasarga</i>. Now begins the case of verbs with <i>upasarga</i>. This debars the affix अण्; as सर्वप्रदः [[6.4.64]] 'giver of all; liberal', पथिप्रज्ञः [[6.4.64]] 'acquainted with roads'. The long आ of दा and ज्ञा is elided by [[6.4.64]].



Why do we say 'when taking प्र'? With any other <i>upasarga</i> these verbs will take the general affix अण्; as गोसन्दाय.
