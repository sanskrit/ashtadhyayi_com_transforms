index: 4.4.77
sutra: धुरो यड्ढकौ

Thus धुरं वहति = धुर्यः (formed by यत्) the lengthening ordained by [[8.2.77]] is prevented by [[7.2.79]] because धुर is <i>Bha</i>-stem, or धौरेयः (formed by डक् [[7.1.2]]) 'a beast of burden'. This <i>sutra</i> might have stood as धुरो ढक् च, for यत् would have been read into it from [[4.4.75]].
