index: 4.4.22
sutra: संसृष्टे

---
The word तेन is understood here. The word संसृष्ट means unification, mixing &c. Thus दध्ना संसृष्ट = दाधिकम् 'smeared with curds' मारिचिकम्, शार्ङ्गवेरिकम् पैप्पलिकम् ॥ The word '<i>sanskrtam</i>' [[4.4.3]] and '<i>sansrshtam</i>' should be distinguished. The former refers to a case where by the combination of two things, a something better is produced; no such idea of bettering is to be found in संसृष्ट ॥
