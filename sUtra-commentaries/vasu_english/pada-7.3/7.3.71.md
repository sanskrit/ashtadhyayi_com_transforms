index: 7.3.71
sutra: ओतः श्यनि

---
As मिश्यति from शो, अवच्छयति from छो, अवद्यति from दो, and अवस्यति from सो ॥ The त् in ओत् is for the sake of euphony or ease of pronunciation.



According to <i>Padamanjari</i>, the <i>sutra</i> should have been ओतः शिति, and thereby there would be the saving of half a <i>matra</i>, and also there would be no necessity of repeating the word शिति in [[7.3.75]].
