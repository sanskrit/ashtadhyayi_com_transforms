As प्रोर्णोत्, प्रौर्णोः ॥ Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of हलि was understood in this <i>sutra</i> from the last aphorism, the employment of the term अपृक्त implies the existence of the following maxim:- यस्मिन् विधिस्तदादावल् ग्रहणे "when a term which denotes a letter is exhibited in a rule, in the form of a Locative case, and qualifies something else which likewise stands in the Locative case, that which is qualified by it must be regarded as beginning with the letter which is denoted by the term in question, and not as ending with it".
