As अजुहवुः, अबिभयुः, अबिभरुः, अजागरुः ॥ This Personal ending is ङित् according to [[1.2.4]], and would not have caused <i>guna</i> (I. I. 5), but for this <i>sutra</i>. The ending जुस (III. 4. I08) comes in the लिङ् also. There, however, it does not cause <i>guna</i>. As चिन्युः, सुनुयुः ॥ Here there are two ङित् affixes, the augment यासुट्, and the <i>sarvadhatuka</i> जुस्; and the यासुट् prevents <i>guna</i>. The इक् is read into the <i>sutra</i> from (I. I. 3).
