As मातरि, पितरि, भ्रातरि, कर्तरि; मातरौ, पितरौ, भ्रातरौ, कर्तारौ, कर्तारः ॥ For the long in कर्तारौ and कर्तारः see [[6.4.11]]. The त् in ऋत् is for the sake of facility of utterance.



Because before ङि and strong cases, it is impossible for a stem to end in a long vowel ॠ nor a <i>dhatu</i> noun can so come, since in that case, long ॠ would be changed to इर् by (VII. I. 100), and in forms like कर्तॄणि there is नुम् ॥
