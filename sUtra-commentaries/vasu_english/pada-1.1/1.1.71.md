sutra: आदिरन्त्येन सहेता

This <i>sutra</i> explains the mode of interpreting <i>pratyaharas</i>. Thus the <i>pratyahara</i> अक् means those letters whose beginning is अ and whose final इत् is क्.



Why do we say with 'the final indicatory letter?' Because a <i>pratyahara</i> like सुट् would be otherwise ambiguous. It might be doubted whether it is formed with the final ट् of औट् and refers to the first five case-affixes, or whether it is formed with the initial ट् of टा and therefore refers to the first seven case-affixes. The present <i>sutra</i> clears up the doubt. A <i>pratyahara</i> is formed with the final इत् and not with the initial इत्.
