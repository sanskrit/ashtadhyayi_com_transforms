sutra: नन्वित्यनुज्ञैषणायाम्

---
The word एषणा means 'asking, praying'. The word अनुज्ञा means 'permission'. The compound अनुज्ञैषणा means 'asking of permission'. Thus ननु करो꣡मि भोः, "may I do it, sir"; ननु ग꣡च्छामि भोः 'can I go sir'. The sense is 'give me permission to do or to go'.



Why do we say when 'asking for permission'? Observe अकार्षी कटं देवदत्त ? ननु क॒॒रो॒॒मि॒॒ भोः '<i>Devadatta</i> hast thou made the mat? Well, I am making it'. Here ननु has the force of an answering particle, and not used in asking permission and hence the verb loses its accent.
