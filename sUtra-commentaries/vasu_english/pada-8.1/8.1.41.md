index: 8.1.41
sutra: शेषे विभाषा

---
What is the शेष alluded to here? The शेष means here senses other than पूजा or 'praise'. Thus कटमहो करिष्यसि or कटमहो क॒॒रि॒॒ष्य॒॒सि॒॒ ॥ This is a speech uttered in anger or envy and not in praise (असूया वचनं) ॥ So also मम गेहमेष्यसि ॥



The word शेष is employed in the <i>sutra</i> simply for the sake of distinctness; for <i>sutra</i> 40 applies to cases of <i>puja</i>, while this <i>sutra</i> will give option in cases other than <i>puja</i>.
