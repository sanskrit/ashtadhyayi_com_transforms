index: 2.4.55
sutra: वा लिटि

---
The लिट् also is an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix and by the last <i>sutra</i> ख्या would always have been the substitute of चक्ष्; the present <i>sutra</i> makes this substitution optional, as आचख्यौ, आचख्यतुः and आचख्युः. In the alterative we have आचचक्षे, आचचक्षाते and आचचक्षिरे 'he told &c.'
