This applies where the compound is not an aggregate by rule [[2.4.12]]; in that case it will be neuter, अश्ववडवाविमौ; अश्ववडवान्, अश्ववडवैः &c., (in every number and case) 'those two (mas.) the horse and the mare.' This is an exception to the last and general rule, by which the gender of the subsequent term, guides the gender of the whole compound.
