sutra: इञः प्राचाम्

पान्नागर + इञ् = पान्नागारिः 'the <i>Gotra</i> descendent of <i>Pannagara</i>'; after this the <i>Yuvan</i> affix फक [[4.1.101]] is elided by the present rule, and so पान्नागारिः is both the father and the son. So मान्यरैषणिः father and son. The word प्राचाम् here qualifies the word <i>Gotra</i> understood and does not show that it is an optional rule in the opinion of Eastern Grammarians. When the <i>Gotra</i> of <i>Prachyas</i> is not denoted, there is no elision. Thus दाक्षिः and दाक्षायणः 'son of <i>Dakshi</i>.'
