And of इङ् 'to study', गमि is the substitute when सन् follows.

अधिजिगांसते, ०सेते, ०सन्ते 'he wishes to study.' The root इङ् is always preceded by the preposition अधि. This will be <i>Atmanepadi</i> by (1. 3. 12) and (I. I. 56). The form is similarly evolved by the application of rules (VII. 2. 58.) and [[6.4.16]].
