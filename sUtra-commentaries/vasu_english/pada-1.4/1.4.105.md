sutra: युष्मद्युपपदे समानाधिकरणे स्थानिन्यपि मध्यमः

---
When the pronoun युष्मद् 'thou' understood, and also when the same expressed, is the attendant word in the agreement with the verb, then there is the verbal termination called the middle (2nd person).

This defines the 2nd person of conjugational affixes. As त्वं पचसि thou cookest or पचसि; युवां पचथः or पचथः you two are cooking; यूयं पचथ or पचथ you cook.
