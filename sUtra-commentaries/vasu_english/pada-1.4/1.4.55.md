index: 1.4.55
sutra: तत्प्रयोजको हेतुश्च

Thus कारयति he causes to be made, हारयति he causes to be taken. When <i>hetu</i> is employed as agent the verb is put in the causative form [[3.1.26]].



The force of the word च is to give both names to the mover of an agent, viz., <i>Hetu</i> and <i>karta</i>: otherwise by <i>sutra</i> 1 of this Chapter only one name would have been given.
