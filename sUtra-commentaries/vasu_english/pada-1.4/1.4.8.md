index: 1.4.8
sutra: पतिः समास एव

---
The word <i>pati</i> would have been <i>ghi</i> by the last <i>sutra</i>; the present <i>sutra</i> is therefore a <i>niyama</i> rule, restricting the use of <i>ghi</i> in the case of <i>pati</i> to its occurring in composition. The word <i>eva</i> 'only' is used in a restrictive sense.



As पत्या by the lord but प्रजापतिना by the lord of creatures. So also पत्ये and प्रजापतये; पत्युः and प्रजापतेः, पत्यौ and प्रजापतौ &c. When पति is <i>ghi</i>, there is <i>guna</i> of the vowel before the four ङित् affixes by [[7.3.111]].
