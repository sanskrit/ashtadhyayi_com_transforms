sutra: कणेमनसी श्रद्धाप्रतीघाते

---
The word श्रद्धा-प्रतीघात means 'satisfaction of desire.' As कणेहत्य पयः पिबति he drinks milk to his heart's content or till he is satisfied ? So also मनोहत्य पयः पिबति. That is to say, he drinks so much till his desire (श्रद्धा) is satisfied by revulsion of feeling. When not having this sense we have कणे or मनोहत्वागतः he went away satisfied.
