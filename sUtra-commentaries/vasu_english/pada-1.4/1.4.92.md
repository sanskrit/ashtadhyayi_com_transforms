That which is like to the principal is called प्रतिनिधि. Giving in return for what is obtained, is प्रतिदान. As अभिमन्युरर्जुनतः प्रति <i> Abhi</i>-<i>manyu</i> is the representative of <i>Arjuna</i>. माषानस्मै तिलेभ्यः प्रतियच्छति he exchanges <i>Mashas</i> for these sesamum. In these senses <i>prati</i> governs the Ablative (II. 3. 11.)
