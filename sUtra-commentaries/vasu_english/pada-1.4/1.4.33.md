---
The verbs having similar meaning (<i>artha</i>) as the word <i>ruchi</i> or 'liking' are रुच्यर्थ. A desire or longing caused by something else, is called <i>ruchi</i>. As देवदत्ताय रोचते मोदकः the sweet meat pleases <i>Devadatta</i>. यज्ञदत्ताय स्वदते ऽपूपः <i>Yajnadatta</i> likes <i>Apupa</i>. Here <i>modaka</i> is the agent that draws out the longing which is latent in <i>Devadatta</i>.



Why do we say 'the person pleased'? Observe देवदत्ताय रोचते मोदकः पथि. <i>Devadatta</i> likes <i>modak</i> in the way. The word <i>pathi</i> being in the 7th case.
