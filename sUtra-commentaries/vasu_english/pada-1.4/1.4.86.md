The word हीन means 'inferior,' and being a comparative term requires the other term with which comparison is made and which is superior; to complete the sense. In other words अनु governs the person to which others are inferior, in the accusative case. As अनुशाकटायनवैयाकरणाः 'all grammarians are inferior to <i>Sakatayana</i>.'
