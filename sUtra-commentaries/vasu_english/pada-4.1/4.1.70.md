sutra: संहितशफलक्षणवामादेश्च

This aphorism applies, when no comparison is intended. As संहितोरूः 'a female whose thighs are joined (e.g. from obesity)' शफोरूः 'whose thighs are put together like the two hoofs on a cow's foot,' लक्षणोरूः 'whose thighs are marked,' वामोरूः 'with handsome thighs.'



Vart:- So also with the words सहित and सह. As सहितोरूः and सहोरूः ॥
