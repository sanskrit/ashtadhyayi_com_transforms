Thus शोणी or शोणा वडवा 'a red or bay mare'. By <i>Phit</i> <i>Sutra</i> II. 10 referred to already in [[4.1.39]] the <i>udatta</i> in शोणा falls on the first syllable, and by [[4.1.40]] it would have taken ङीष् always; but the present <i>sutra</i> makes a <i>niyama</i> rule and restricts the application of ङीष् according to the opinion of Eastern Grammarians only, and not of others.
