This is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i> pure and simple. The phrase 'when feminine nature is to be indicated', must be read in all the following aphorisms upto 81 inclusive. The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word '<i>pratipadika</i>' should be read into this <i>sutra</i>, from the first <i>sutra</i>, not so, however, the <i>anuvritti</i> of the words 'ङी-आप्'; for we are now going to form words by the application of ङी and आप् affixes.
