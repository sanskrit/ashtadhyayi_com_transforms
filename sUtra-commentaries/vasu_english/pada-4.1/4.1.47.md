Thus विभ्वी, प्रभ्वी, सुभ्वी, शम्भ्वी ॥



But why not so in the case of स्वयभूः? Because it ends in long ऊ, while विभ्वी &c. are feminine of विभु &c. ending in short उ ॥ In fact the word उतः "after a word ending in short उ" of <i>Sutra</i> [[4.1.44]] governs this also. The word भुवः is the ablative case of भु irregularly formed by the substitution of उवङ्; this form being confined to <i>sutras</i> only.
