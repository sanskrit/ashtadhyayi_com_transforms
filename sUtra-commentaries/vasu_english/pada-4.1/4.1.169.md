Both these are names of countries and denote also <i>Kshatriyas</i> as well. Therefore, by <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.171]] they having a <i>Vriddhi</i> in the first syllable, would have taken the affix 'nyan', the present <i>sutra</i> enjoins 'an' instead. Thus साल्वेयः 'the son of <i>Salveya</i>, or the king of <i>Salveya</i>', गान्धारः 'the son of <i>Gandhari</i> or the king of <i>Gandhari</i>?'  The <i>vartika</i> under <i>Sutra</i> [[4.1.168]] given above applies here also, i.e. the affix denotes also 'the king there of'
