As युवतिः 'a young maid'. By [[4.1.5]], ङीप् would have been otherwise employed, the present <i>sutra</i> debars it. The word युवति ending in इ does not take the affix ङीष् of [[4.1.65]], for the affix ति itself is a feminine-making affix though a <i>Taddhita</i>: or the word युवन् may be regarded as a non-<i>jati</i> word and hence [[4.1.65]] would not apply.
