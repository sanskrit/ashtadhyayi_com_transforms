index: 4.1.64
sutra: पाककर्णपर्णपुष्पफलमूलवालोत्तरपदाच्च

---
Here the affix applies to words which in their original sense denoted females and therefore were not provided by the last <i>sutra</i>. Thus ओदनपाकी, शंककुर्णी, शालपर्णी, शंखपुष्पी, दासीफली दर्भमूली, and गोवाली ॥



When, however the affix ङीष् is not intended to be applied to compounds ending with फल, पुष्प, and मूल, then those compounds will fall under <i>Ajadi</i> class [[4.1.4]]; such as संफला, भस्त्रफला, सत्पुष्पा, अमूला &c.
