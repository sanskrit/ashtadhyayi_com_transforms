sutra: घ्वसोरेद्धावभ्यासलोपश्च

Thus देहि, and धेहि, of घु, and एधि of अस्, the स being elided by this <i>sutra</i>, and अ being elided by [[6.4.111]]. This लोप of the present <i>sutra</i> should be considered as having an indicatory श् so that the whole of the reduplicated and not only the final letter of the <i>abhyasa</i> [[1.1.55]] is elided.
