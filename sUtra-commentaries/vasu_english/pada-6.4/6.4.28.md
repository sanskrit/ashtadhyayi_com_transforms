sutra: स्यदो जवे

The word स्यद् is formed by घञ् in the sense of 'speed'.

This word is derived from स्यन्द, the nasal is elided, and the <i>Vriddhi</i> prohibited irregularly. Though the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix घञ् causes here the elision of a portion of the root, viz of न् of स्यन्द्, yet rule (I. I. 4) does not apply here. That rule prohibits <i>Guna</i> and <i>Vriddhi</i>, only in case of इक् vowels, here the <i>Vriddhi</i> is prevented with regard to अ ॥ The prevention of this <i>Vriddhi</i> is irregular and not governed by (I. I. 4). Thus गोस्यदः अश्वस्यदः meaning "cow-speed," "horse-speed." but तैलस्यन्दः, and घृतस्यन्दः meaning "dripping of oil or ghee".
