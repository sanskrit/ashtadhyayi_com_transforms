index: 6.4.123
sutra: राधो हिंसायाम्

---
Thus अपरेधतुः, अपरेधुः, अपरेधिथ, but रराधतुः, रराधुः, रराधिथ in any other sense than that of 'hurting'. In this <i>sutra</i> the long आ of राध is to be replaced by ए, the <i>anuvritti</i> of short अ (अतः [[6.4.120]]) is therefore not appropriate here. We should either read the <i>anuvritti</i> of आ from [[6.4.112]], or we should read the word एकहलमध्ये in this way "in राध् whatever stands between two simple consonants is replaced by ए".
