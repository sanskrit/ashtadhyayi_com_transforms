Thus उपदिदीये, उपदिदीयाते and उपदिदीयिरे ॥ The Personal ending is कित् by [[1.2.5]]. दीङः being in the Ablative case, the augment is applied to the affix. This augment, however, is not to be considered as <i>asiddha</i> [[6.4.22]] for the purposes of semi-vowel substitution under [[6.4.82]]. If that substitution were allowed, the augment would become useless. Why before an affix having क् or ङ् ? Observe उपदानम् ॥
