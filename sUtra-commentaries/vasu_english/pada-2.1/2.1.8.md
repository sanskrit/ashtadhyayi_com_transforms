sutra: यावदवधारणे

---
The word अवधारण means accurate ascertainment, restriction or limitation. As, यावदमत्रं ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयस्व invite so many <i>Bráhmanas</i> only and not more as there are pots': i.e., if there are five pots then invite five <i>Bráhmans</i>; if six pots, then invite six <i>Bráhmans</i>. 



Why do we say 'when meaning limitation'? Observe यावद्दत्तं तावत् भुक्तम् 'I ate so long as it was given to me,' i.e. I do not know for certainty how much I have eaten.
