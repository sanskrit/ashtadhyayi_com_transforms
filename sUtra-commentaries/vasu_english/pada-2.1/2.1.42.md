As, तीर्थध्वाङ्क्षः 'a crow at the sacred bathing place' i.e., a very greedy person; as a crow in a bathing place does not remain long, any where, so a person who goes to his teacher's house and does not tarry there long, is called a तीर्थकाकः or a तीर्थवायसः.



When it has not this meaning, there is no compounding: as, तीर्थध्वाङ्क्षस्तिष्ठति 'There is a crow in the sacred bathing place.'
