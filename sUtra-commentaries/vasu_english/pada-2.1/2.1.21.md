index: 2.1.21
sutra: अन्यपदार्थे च संज्ञायाम्

The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>samkhyå</i> does not extend to this <i>sutra</i>. Though this rule is given in the sub-division relating to optional compounds it is, however, a <i>Nitya-samasa</i> rule : for no Name (सञ्ज्ञा) can ever be expressed by a sentence, and that being so, these compounds can never be analysed. As उन्मत्तगङ्गम् ' the country called <i>Unmatta Ganges</i> .' So also लोहितगङ्गम्, कृष्णगङ्गम् ; शनैर्गङ्गम्.



Why do we say 'when it denotes a thing other than that expressed by the component parts of the compound' ? Observe कृष्णवेण the 'river <i>Krishnavena</i>.'



Why do we say 'when it expresses an Appellative' ? Observe शीर्घो गङ्गो देशः ' the country where the <i>Ganges</i> moves rapidly.'
