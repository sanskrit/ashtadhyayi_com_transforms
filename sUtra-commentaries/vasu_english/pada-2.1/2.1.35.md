sutra: भक्ष्येण मिश्रीकरणम्

---
Anything eatable, whether hard or soft, is called भक्ष्य; its refinement is called मिश्रीकरणं. As गुडधानाः  'barley prepared with jaggery;' गुडपृथकाः  'flattened parched rice prepared with jaggery.' 

 The connection here also between the two words is established by a verb understood.
