sutra: स्वयं क्तेन

The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word द्वितीया from the last aphorism into this, cannot take place; though, however, it is understood in the next <i>sūtra</i>. The word स्वयम् being an Indeclinable, cannot take any case-affix. As स्वयै धौतौ पदौ 'feet washed by himself' स्वयं विलीनमज्यम्.



In this compounding, the two words do not appear to have undergone any change after their composition. They are the same as they were before the composition. But by calling their juxtaposition, 'a compound,' two indirect advantages are gained. Namely these two words are regarded as one word, and their accent is also similarly regulated. See Rule (VI. I. 223).



The words ending in <i>kta</i> which is a <i>Nistha</i>. affix, are past participles.
