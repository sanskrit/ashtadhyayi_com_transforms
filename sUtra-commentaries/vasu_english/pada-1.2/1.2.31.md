index: 1.2.31
sutra: समाहारः स्वरितः

---
The word "vowel" of s. 28 is understood here also. The <i>svarita</i> or circumflexed accent is pronounced by the combined raising and falling of the voice. It is marked by a perpendicular line on the top of the letter.

The word is used in <i>sutra</i> (VI. I. 185) \[1\]. "The affixes having an indicatory त् <i>t</i> have <i>svarita</i> accent." As क॒॒न्या॑ <i>kanya</i>, शि॒॒क्य॑म् <i>sikyam</i>, क्व॑ <i>kva</i>.



This <i>sutra</i> is not to be understood to mean that a <i>svarita</i> is the resultant of the combination of two vowels, an <i>udatta</i> vowel with an <i>anudatta</i> vowel. It means the accent midway between the two well-known qualities of letters known as acute and grave accents.
